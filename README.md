> Hi Image Gallery Users,
> 
> We're finally getting back on track with the extension development. Here‚Äôs what we really need from you:
> - üíª Code Contributions: Dive into the codebase and help us by submitting pull requests. Whether it‚Äôs adding new features, or improving the existing ones, your contributions are crucial. We'll lay out a contribution guideline soon (you may contribute to this too).
> - üí° Feature Suggestions: We welcome your ideas to make this tool more useful, especially for those in the computer vision field, where our extension has found a significant user base. But, suggestions for features that you think would be useful for all users are welcome too.
> - üí¨ Spread the Word: Share your experience with the extension. A wider user and contributor base helps drive the project forward.
> 
> Looking ahead, our goal is to collaborate closely with all users, addressing your needs and incorporating valuable enhancements. However, we may have limitations on addressing all issues promptly as we have our full-time jobs during weekdays. Your patience and contributions will highly be appreciated. Lastly, thank you for your continued support.

## Highlights
- **Remote**: Excellent for browsing images on a cloud (e.g. via [SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh))
- **Gallery**: Collapsible grid view of all images in the selected folder, including its sub-folders
- **Performance**: Lazy loading of images (tested on 10k images with a start-up time of 1.5s)
- **Refresh**: Automatically update view as images are modified, added, or deleted
- **Light**: Extension size less than 1 MB, installation time is typically negligible
