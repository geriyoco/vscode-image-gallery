### Added
- Telemetry for feature insights. We strive to be transparent at what we collect. See [`telemetry.json`](telemetry.json) for all the events we collect. Following the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement), we do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Check out the open-source repository at [here](https://github.com/geriyoco/vscode-image-gallery) to inspect the code. You can always opt-out of telemetry by setting `geriyocoImageGallery.isTelemetryEnabled` to `false` in your VS Code settings. Visit [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/telemetry) to learn more about VS Code telemetry.
